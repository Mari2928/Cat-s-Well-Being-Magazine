		<h3 id="exercise">Make exercise fun</h3>
        	Is your cat exercising enough? Moderate exercise is an essential component of a cat’s well-being. 
		Only through exercise can a cat maintain strong bones and muscles and a healthy metabolic system. 
		If you do not pay attention to this, your cat can quickly become fat and fall into a vicious cycle that he or she won’t easily escape from. 
		Obesity is always a passport to disease. You can create a system that is safe and intriguing for cats and makes them want to move and play. 
		For example, by lowering the height of a cat tower or making slopes so that a cat can go to a favorite high place, 
		even an old cat can patrol every day. 
		Here, we will introduce how to create a system where cats can enjoy exercise to strengthen themselves.<br>

		<h3 id="weaknesses">Address weaknesses</h3>
        	Do you know what a cat's weaknesses are? 
		The ancestors of cats lived in the desert, so a cat's body was adapted to this environment and a cat can live with less water. 
		However, less water damages the kidney, which can cause kidney disease and some urological problems. 
		We can say that the one of the weaknesses of cats is kidneys. 
		However, if the kidneys are weak, blood pressure rises because the body further increases blood flow to filter creatine or BUN. 
		A rise in blood pressure can damage the heart. 
		Because many of these organs are functionally connected, a cat’s weaknesses will need to include the heart and liver in addition to the kidneys.
		 Here we explain how to maintain the cat's kidneys, heart and liver in good condition.<br>

		<article>
		<h3 id="additives">Avoid additives</h3>
        	As a human, if you eat more additives from junk foods and chemical seasonings for your meal, 
		you become more susceptible to diseases by disrupting the functioning of the natural circulatory and immune systems. 
		This is the same for cats. Cats love food with additives, but in the long run they can damage the cat's internal organs and cause illness. 
		This is because additives may have a small effect on a large human body, but a large effect on a small cat body. 
		Only you, the owner, can control a cat's diet. 
		In order to support the well-being of a cat, here we write about forming a simple life routine that avoids additives.<br>
